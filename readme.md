Hi. 
I develope "My startup progress" list.
What was done?
1)Server - base on NodeJs(Express).
2)Postgres as database.
3)Frontend - React, MUI, ApolloClient.
4)GraphQL - for requests.



For starting project you need to do next things: 
1)Install postgres.
2)Download this project.
3)Configurate backend/config/config.json for db connection.
4)Add some data to database, for this you could check "graphql.txt". File contains queries and mutations which you can write to "http://localhost:5000/graphql"
5)Use "npm install" in backend
6)Use "npm install" in frontend
7)Now run backend "npm start"
8)Now run frontend "npm start"

backend use's 5000 port
frontend use's 3000 port
